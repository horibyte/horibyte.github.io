<p>As you’ve might seen today, I’ve launched a new front-end of my website for old browsers, made completely with 
<strong>Microsoft FrontPage 2003</strong>, and well, today I’ll be telling the type of bugs I had to go through…</p>

<h1 id="the-begining">The begining</h1>

<p>At the start it was pretty nice, I had the “Split” view enabled since I wasn’t so sure about the whole WYSIWYG and that stuff, it was kinda nice and I did a nice test page, but then the problems arose..</p>

<h2 id="the-navegation-bar">The navegation bar</h2>

<p>If you are vieweing this on the modern website, this is how it looks like:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2025-03-09/navbar.png" alt="Horibyte Website Retro Front-end navegation bar" style="width:-moz-available;height:auto;" /></p>

<p>And oh boy, it was sure painful to get everything right…</p>

<p>Here are some screenshots of me not getting it to work cuz I have no idea how to explain it:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2025-03-09/discord-thing-1.png" alt="" style="width:-moz-available;height:auto;" /></p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2025-03-09/discord-thing-2.png" alt="" style="width:-moz-available;height:auto;" /></p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2025-03-09/discord-thing-3.png" alt="" style="width:-moz-available;height:auto;" /></p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2025-03-09/discord-thing-4.png" alt="" style="width:-moz-available;height:auto;" /></p>

<p>As you can see, it was trial and error to get the navbar..bar to get fully working, which took 7 hours between 2 days of fixing…yeah I could do it in like 15 mins or so but nah this took me that amount of time. Insane.</p>

<p>Not only it didn’t just want to put the text properly, I had to come up with some weird fixes for it to even go to the max of the screen like it does now.</p>

<h2 id="blog-and-centering-too">Blog, and centering, too</h2>

<p>You thought the blog didn’t have its issues, nah, it did.</p>

<p>Even tho I don’t have more screenshots of it, it was kind of pain to make the blog homepage work, here’s another example</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2025-03-09/discord-thing-6.png" alt="" style="width:-moz-available;height:auto;" /></p>

<p>Yeah things also refused to center properly, as you can see here:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2025-03-09/discord-thing-5.png" alt="" style="width:-moz-available;height:auto;" /></p>

<p>Something that always annoyed me is that the Design mode is not really accurate to the preview, which made debugging it like 10x harder.</p>

<p>Lists/bullets didn’t want to work either with the fix I added which was weird..</p>

<p>When I was done with the navbar + blog, I just went to port everything else which was easy, I made the Projects and Socials page be lists cuz I’m NOT bothering to make the goddamn boxes after all I did for a single box.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In the end, everything went out alright, it’s just that I suck with WYSIWYG, mainly because I’m already used to coding in general.</p>

<div class="container" style="color: lightgray; font-size: small;">
You tell me people didn't have to debug the heck out of an HTML file for it to only be a missing &lt;/div&gt;? Insane!
